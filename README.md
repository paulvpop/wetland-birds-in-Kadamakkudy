# wetland-birds-in-Kadamakkudy
A project to understand the trends in wetland waterbirds in the Kadamakudy wetlands (Kerala, India) over the last decade using eBird data.

This is my contribution to a chapter in a Cochin Natural History Society (CNHS) report and it is expected to finish within a few weeks or a few months. The full code will be uploaded upon the completion.
